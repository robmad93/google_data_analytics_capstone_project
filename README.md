# Google data analytics capstone project
This repository contains the data sets and R script used to conduct an analysis of "Cyclistic" trip data, which I performed to complete the Google Data Analytics capstone project.
Please download the file named cyclistic_analysis.doxc to see the full report.

**Important note:** As Github places restrictions on file sizes that exceed 100 Mb, I have had to convert the original .csv files into .xlsx files. To run the code in the file named cyclistic_analysis.R, you will first need to convert these .xlsx files into .csv files once you have downloaded them.
